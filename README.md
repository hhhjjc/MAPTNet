# Multi-Scale Adaptive Prototype Transformer Network for Few-shot Strip Steel Surface Defect Segmentation

we propose a few-shot segmentation method named Multi-scale Adaptive Prototype Transformer Network (MAPTNet), which aims to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation and improve adaptability of defect detection for diverse and complex defect scenarios.




## Get Started

### Environment

### Dataset

Please download the following dataset from [CPANet](https://github.com/VDT-2048/CPANet) and put them into the `../FSSD-12` directory.

## Models

We have adopted the same procedures as [CPANet](https://github.com/VDT-2048/CPANet) for the pre-trained backbones, placing them in the `./initmodel` directory. 

## Scripts

- First update the configurations in the `./config` for training or testing

- Train script
```
sh train.sh
```
- Test script
```
sh test.sh
```
